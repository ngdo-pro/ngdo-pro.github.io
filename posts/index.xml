Along the years, I created many side-projects (never finished one ðŸ˜…).
Each one got its own user management code.
I have other projects in mind, but I thought this time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to build an application to avoid re-implementing the same system over and over again !
Many solutions already exists, so why build an other one ? Because the goal here is not to provide an application for the world to use, it&amp;rsquo;s about learning stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
